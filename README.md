## Introduction

Cicero allows you to define natural language contract and clause templates that can be executed by a computer. These could be relatively simple things like `if the goods are more than {{DAYS}} late, then notify the supplier of the goods, with the message {{MESSAGE}}.` or more elaborate natural language and logic such as computing interest on a loan, or calculating penalties based on IoT sensor readings.

You can browse the library of Open Source Cicero contract and clause templates at: https://templates.accordproject.org.

Cicero is an Open Source implementation of the [Accord Project Template Specification][apspec]. It defines the structure of natural language templates, bound to a data model, that can be executed using request/response JSON messages.

You can read the latest user documentation here: http://docs.accordproject.org.

## Clause Templates

Using Cicero you can take any existing natural language text (typically a clause or a contract) and declaratively bind it to a data model. Cicero generates a parser to parse and validate source text, extracting machine readable/computable data. The Cicero engine can then be used to execute a clause (an instance of a template) against a JSON payload. Accord Project templates can be used to add computable functionality to any document.

## Structure of the Code Repository

Top level repository (cicero), with sub packages. Each sub-package is published as an independent npm module managed as npm packages:
* [cicero-cli](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero/tree/master/packages/cicero-cli) : Command line interface (for parsing, execution, creating archives) for Accord Project legal templates
* [cicero-core](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero/tree/master/packages/cicero-core) : Core classes to manage the grammar, models and logic of Accord Project legal templates
* [generator-cicero-template](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero/tree/master/packages/generator-cicero-template): Utility to create a self-contained directory for a new Accord Project legal template

## Installation

To install the command-line interface:

```
npm install -g @accordproject/cicero-cli
```
